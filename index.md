# Introduction

This site is meant as an introduction to command line (or console) and git, in [Centria University of Applied Sciences](https://web.centria.fi/en). With this course you will learn the basics of *command line* tools as well as version control, namely *git*.

# Prerequisites

To be able to complete this course, you need access to a \*nix command line and git. 

## On \*nix computers
If you are using a Linux or Mac computer, you are all set, as git is pre-installed. If for some reason it is not, you can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/). To find out if you have git, open your command line (or terminal in Mac) and type in `git --help`. This will show you the available git commands.


## On Windows
If you have Windows, you need to download *Git bash*. You can get it from here: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and you can find instructions for installation from here: [https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/](https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/).

The application *Git bash* works as your command line, but also includes git. Open the application and type `git --help` to test that your git works.

## Alternative in Windows

Alternatively, you can also get the *Linux subsystem for Windows* (or LSW). You can follow the instructions from here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). If you do this, I suggest you choose *Ubuntu 20.04 LTS* as the distribution.

*NOTICE!* This installation of LSW is well beyond the scope of this course, and you will not receive support for this from the lecturer.

*NOTICE!* You only need either Git Bash *or* Linux subsystem, not both.

# Exercises

The exercises are inside the material text. Do the exercises when the material tell you to. 

*NOTICE!* Some of the command line commands in the material might not work in Git Bash, and that is just fine. Read the material of that section, and move on. All the commands should work as such on Mac and Linux, as well as in the Linux subsystem.s
